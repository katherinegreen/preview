## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Using Flexbox to align icons with texts
- Using absolute position on overlay to achieve interaction on a picture
- Remember to do CSS reset at the beginning, at least resetting margin, padding and box-sizing
- After wrapping h1 or other elements inside anchor, underscores are deleted in the anchor element and fonts are better to be changed in the child elements
- To center an absolute-positioned element, combining top, left and transform properties

### Continued development

- How to apply screen width, both mobile and desktop (in the style guide, two screed widths are offered) when designing? Should I explicitly set the width of the container to be an absolute width?

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me for understanding CSS properties.
